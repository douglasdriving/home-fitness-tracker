# Home Fitness Tracker - Design Specification

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Product Vision
A progressive, open-source, local-first web application designed for fitness beginners who want to build core strength to prevent back injuries, improve posture, and develop overall strength. The app provides guided workouts that progressively adapt to the user's capabilities.

### 1.2 Target Audience
- Beginners with little workout experience
- People who want to exercise at home
- Users concerned about data privacy (local-first approach)
- Anyone looking to build core strength without gym equipment

### 1.3 Core Principles
- **Local-First**: All data stored on the user's device
- **Progressive**: Workouts adapt to user's improving strength
- **Accessible**: Works on both Android and iPhone as a PWA
- **Simple**: No equipment needed except a yoga mat
- **Safe**: Legitimate exercise instructions to prevent injury

- **Target Muscle Group(s)**: abs, glutes, lower back
- **Description**: Step-by-step instructions on proper form
- **Media Reference**: Link to YouTube video or image demonstration
- **Source Attribution**: Reference to legitimate fitness source
- **Heaviness Score**: Numeric weight indicating difficulty relative to other exercises in the same muscle group
- **Type**: Rep-based or time-based
- **Equipment Required**: Yoga mat only

**Muscle Groups Covered** (Initial Version):
1. Abs (core/abdominals)
2. Glutes (posterior)
3. Lower Back (erector spinae)

---

### 2.2 Workout Plans

**Purpose**: Generate progressive workout schedules tailored to user's current fitness level.

**Workout Structure**:
- **Duration**: Starting at ~20 minutes, progressively increasing
- **Exercise Selection**: Mix of exercises covering all 3 muscle groups
- **Variety**: Different exercise combinations in each workout
- **Sets & Reps**: Defined per exercise based on user capacity
- **Rest Time**: Suggested rest period between sets (e.g., 60-90 seconds)

**Display Format**:
- List view showing upcoming workouts
- "Next Workout" prominently displayed
- Each workout shows:
  - All exercises included
  - Sets per exercise
  - Reps per set (or duration for timed exercises)

**Generation Logic**:
- Generated immediately after completing previous workout
- Uses historical data to determine progression
- Balances all 3 muscle groups
- Varies exercises to prevent monotony

---

### 2.3 Workout Execution

**Purpose**: Guide users through their workout step-by-step with flexibility for real-time adjustments.

**User Experience Flow**:

1. **Exercise View**
   - Display current exercise name
   - Show total sets and reps required
   - Toggle-able instructions panel
   - Optional media (video/image) display

2. **Set Tracking**
   - Visual checklist for each set
   - Check off completed sets
   - Progress indicator showing overall workout completion

3. **Rep/Duration Input**
   - Each set shows target reps/duration as editable input field
   - User can click to adjust if they complete more/fewer reps
   - App auto-adjusts remaining sets to match user's actual capacity
   - Adjusted values are saved to history

4. **Timer Integration**
   - **Exercise Timer** (for timed exercises): Built-in countdown timer that auto-checks set when complete
   - **Rest Timer**: Automatic countdown between sets (e.g., 60 seconds)
   - Rest timer starts when user completes a set
   - User can skip rest or let it complete naturally

5. **Completion**
   - Set complete → check exercise
   - All exercises complete → stretching routine (if enabled) → workout complete
   - Workout complete screen shows per-exercise progression (set-by-set results vs personal best), milestone unlocks/retirements

---

### 2.4 First-Time Calibration

**Purpose**: Establish baseline strength levels for accurate workout generation.

**Calibration Flow**:

1. **Welcome Screen**
   - Explain the calibration purpose
   - Estimated time: 10-15 minutes

2. **Calibration Exercises**
   - Select 1-2 representative exercises per muscle group
   - Exercises chosen for easy measurement and safety

3. **User Testing**
   - Instructions for each calibration exercise
   - User performs exercise to their comfortable maximum
   - User inputs achieved reps/duration

4. **Baseline Calculation**
   - App calculates initial strength levels for each muscle group
   - Sets starting workout difficulty
   - Stores baseline data for future progression calculations

---

### 2.5 History & Progress Tracking

**Purpose**: Track all completed workouts and provide insights into progress.

**Data Stored per Workout**:
- Date and time completed
- All exercises performed
- Actual sets completed
- Actual reps/duration per set (not planned values)
- Total workout duration
- Muscle groups worked

**History View**:
- Chronological list of past workouts
- Expandable workout details
- Visual indicators for completed workouts

**Data Storage**:
- All history stored locally in browser storage
- No server-side storage
- Privacy-focused approach

---

### 2.6 Progressive Overload System

**Purpose**: Automatically increase workout difficulty to build strength over time.

**Progression Logic**:

1. **Repeated Exercise**
   - If user has done exercise before
   - Increment load slightly (e.g., +1-2 reps or +5-10 seconds)
   - Based on previous performance

2. **New Exercise**
   - If user hasn't done exercise before
   - Estimate capacity using:
     - Historical data from same muscle group
     - Heaviness score comparison
     - Conservative starting point

3. **Adaptation Triggers**
   - Generate next workout after current workout completion
   - Incorporate latest performance data
   - Adjust difficulty based on user's actual completed reps

**Safety Considerations**:
- Gradual progression to prevent injury
- Never increase by more than 10% per workout
- Allow user overrides if needed

---

### 2.7 Data Backup & Restore

**Purpose**: Enable users to backup their workout history to prevent data loss.

**Backup Features**:
- Export workout data to file
- Upload/sync to Google Drive
- Download backup file to device

**Restore Features**:
- Import backup file
- Merge or replace existing data
- Conflict resolution options
