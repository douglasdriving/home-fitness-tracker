- when you switch tab, the main window is kept scrolled to the state of your last one. this does not make sense. Instead, when you switch tabs, please make it so that you automatically scroll to the top of the page
- most of the screens are scrollable even though there is more than enough space to fit them onto the page (all but exercises at start, and proably history once you start populate it). It is almost as though the window has been made higher than the screen size. Instead, make it adapt to the screen size, so that the scroll bar only appears when needed.
- it would be great if there was a way inside of the app to add feedback, suggestions, or report bugs, so that this can be done when you use it. please come up with a smart and simple way for how the user can do this so that it gets stored somewhere in the cloud in a way that is readable. it would be best if you can avoid having to set up a whole backend and stuff, and use what is already avaliable, perhaps if there is some way to submit feedback/issue directly to github or vercel via a link or so
