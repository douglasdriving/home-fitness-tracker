# Bugs & Feature Requests - Priority Ordered

## âœ… COMPLETED

- [x] **#1: Pre-fill input fields with target values**

## ðŸ”´ CRITICAL PRIORITY (Breaks Core Functionality)

- [x] **#13: Calibration strength calculation is broken**
  - Issue: 90s plank â†’ strength level 3 â†’ next workout generates 3x10s plank (way too easy)
  - Fix: Changed formula from `/ 6` to `* (10/6)` to make it inverse of estimation formula
  - Done when: 90s plank calibration results in appropriate workout difficulty
  - Status: FIXED âœ“ (90s now gives strength 30 â†’ 90s workout)

## ðŸŸ  HIGH PRIORITY (Major UX Issues)

- [x] **#14: Add timer to calibration screen for timed exercises**
  - Issue: Users must exit app to time their plank during calibration

  - Status: FIXED âœ“

- [x] **#12: Remove redundant title bars from all pages**
  - Issue: Title bar at top takes up space, bottom nav already shows location
  - Fix: Removed header sections from Dashboard, History, ExerciseLibrary, Settings
  - Done when: Pages start with content, no title bar header
  - Status: FIXED âœ“

- [x] **#17: Calibration timer should count up, not down**
  - Issue: Timer counts down from 10 minutes, confusing for calibration where you enter seconds achieved
  - Fix: Added countUp and showSecondsOnly modes to Timer component
  - Done when: Calibration timer counts up from 0s and user can easily read seconds
  - Status: FIXED âœ“

- [x] **#20: Scroll position persists when switching tabs**
  - Issue: When switching tabs, page stays scrolled to previous position instead of starting at top
  - Fix: Added ScrollToTop component that watches route changes and scrolls to top
  - Done when: Every tab switch starts at the top of the new page
  - Status: FIXED âœ“

- [x] **#21: Unnecessary scrollbars on pages with enough space**
  - Issue: Pages are scrollable even when content fits, as if window is taller than screen

  - Done when: Scroll only appears when content actually exceeds screen height
  - Status: FIXED âœ“

## ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM PRIORITY (Confusing UX)

- [x] **#5: Remove confusing strength level stats from dashboard**
  - Issue: "Avg strength" and "Strength levels" section are unclear and redundant
  - Fix: Removed average strength stat and strength levels breakdown section
  - Done when: Dashboard no longer shows any strength-related stats
  - Status: FIXED âœ“

  - Fix: Added "Total", "This Week", and "This Month" workout counts to Quick Stats
  - Done when: Dashboard shows workout count for current week and month
  - Status: FIXED âœ“

- [x] **#4: Show calibration data somewhere**
  - Issue: Can't view initial calibration results anywhere
  - Fix: Added "Calibration Results" section to Settings with date and achieved values
  - Done when: User can see their calibration results in Settings
  - Status: FIXED âœ“

- [x] **#18: Calibration should inform sustainable workout targets**
  - Issue: Workouts used calibration max as-is, but calibration tests single-set max (not sustainable for multiple sets)
  - Fix: Apply 75% multiplier to estimated capacity - all sets use same sustainable target
  - Done when: Workouts use realistic targets (e.g., 90s calibration â†’ 3x68s workout, not 3x90s)
  - Status: FIXED âœ“

## ðŸŸ¢ LOW PRIORITY (Polish & Nice-to-Have)
