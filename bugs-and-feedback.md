- when you do a set with timed exercises, the input field of how much you did has to be filled out. instead, it should have the intended time/reps as a default value, so that you only have to change it in you diverge from the plan
- if you do less than the planned number of reps in a set, and add a lower value, the sets after that one should adjust to be the same value as what you adjusted to, so that the app adjusts to the users capacity. this does not happen now, the number just resets to the planned number of reps.
- in the rest timer, there are 2 skip buttons. one is next to "pause" and one is below the pause and skip button. the pause button is also redundant in this view, so you can remove both the pause button and the skip button right of that, and just keep a single skip button underneath the rest timer.
- the calibration data does not show up as a workout in history, and I do not find a place to see my initially calibrated values. please add the calibration data as a history entry, or as a separate field, so that I can look at it.
- At the home view, there are a couple of confusing stats. One is "Avg strength" and the other ones are the "strength levels" at the bottom. It is unclear what these all mean, and right now they are redundant. you can remove all strength level stats for now.
- quick stat you can add instead of avg strength is "workouts this month" and "workouts this week"
